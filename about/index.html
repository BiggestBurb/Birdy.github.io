    <div id="history">
      <p> Hi there! My name is Birdy, and I'm a lazy Burb based in THE UNITED STATES ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…. I can barely spell, have never worked or done anything notable,
         and have won no awards. In my free time, I love watching movies and being social, even though I consider myself an introvert.
          Movies allow me to escape the world, and I love talking to people, but I never really do talk to anyone ðŸ¤·. 
          I'm a lazy individual who values sleep and the 4 friends I have. I'm dedicated to finishing One Piece ðŸ«¡!!! 
          This site is almost a year old; I made it while learning how to code, and I was getting really good, but I gave up and stopped completely, and now I don't even know HTML ðŸ˜­. 
          My favorite artists are $uicideboy$, Lucki, Chris Travis, Chief Keef, Hotel Ugly, Tyler The Creator, PinkPantheress, TV Girl, & Tame Impala. 
          My favorite games are Conker's Bad Fur Day, Lollipop Chainsaw, Half-Life, VRChat, & Red Dead Redemption 2.
         My favorite quote is "My weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing. Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding." â€“ $uicideboy$</p>
